# Phishing
The Phishing Detection System is a machine learning-based solution designed to detect phishing emails by analysing email content. Using a combination of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Random Forest classification, the system identifies whether an email is likely to be a phishing attempt or a legitimate message.

Key Features:
Email Preprocessing: The system processes the email content by removing irrelevant punctuation, stop words, and normalising the text for feature extraction.

Phishing Detection: The system classifies emails into phishing or legitimate categories, providing a prediction result with an associated confidence score.

Machine Learning: Utilises a Random Forest classifier, trained on a labelled dataset of phishing and non-phishing emails, to predict the nature of incoming emails.

Flask API: A simple Flask web application that allows users to send POST requests containing email content and receive predictions on whether the email is phishing.

How It Works:
Training: The system is trained on a dataset consisting of emails, where each email is labelled as either phishing or legitimate. The text of each email is transformed into TF-IDF features to feed into the machine learning model.

Preprocessing and Classification: Once the email is received, it is preprocessed to extract useful features, such as the subject and body content. The model then classifies the email based on these features.

Flask API: The system exposes a RESTful API, allowing users to submit email content and receive a prediction (phishing or not) along with a confidence score.

Setup Instructions:
Install Dependencies: The system requires several Python libraries, including scikit-learn, spacy, and flask. You can install them using pip.

Dataset: You'll need a dataset of phishing and legitimate emails for training. The dataset should include the email content and the corresponding label indicating whether it is phishing.

Run the System: Once the system is set up, you can start the Flask server, which listens for incoming POST requests containing email content. It will return a prediction on whether the email is phishing or legitimate.

Usage:
Once the system is running, users can send email content to the /scan endpoint of the Flask API. The response will contain:

A boolean value (is_phishing) indicating whether the email is phishing.

A confidence score (confidence) showing the model's certainty about the prediction.

Potential Applications:
Email Security: This system can be integrated into email servers to automatically filter out phishing emails before they reach users' inboxes.

User Protection: By using this system, users can have an additional layer of protection against phishing attacks, helping them avoid falling victim to scams.

This project serves as a foundation for phishing email detection, and it can be expanded with additional features like real-time detection, integration with email clients, or the use of more advanced machine learning models for better accuracy.
